# PersonalBlog

## Briefing

This was a project designed to learn and optimize my abilities regarding CRUD APIs and developing a front end interface. 
It was intended to simulate a personal blog to post about pretty much everything.

## Dependencies
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Validation
- PostgreSQL Driver
- Spring Boot DevTools

## Packages
- Controller: is a mediator between the user and the app, receiving input and converting it to a model or a view. Contains methods and functions related to HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Model: is the app's data structure. 
- Repository: stores data, preparing it for retrieval by requests in the controller.
- Utils: a component aimed to test creating posts before enabling the button and html designed to create them.
- Service: a class and interface developed to create and initiliaze methods to find and save posts in order for them to be used elsewhere.

## What I've learned in this project

First, I've educated myself into creating methods and functions concerning http requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 
Furthermore, I've comprehended how to create databases in PostgreSQL through shell comands, while also learning how to set up PostgreSQL local server in my PC.
I've understood how to link my app in IntelliJ and the local database server hosted by PostgreSQL.
Finally, I've managed to get in contact with thymeleaf and develop front end interface to my back end apps.
